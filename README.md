# üëã Hello! My name is Ville Virtanen


## About me

I'm currently a senior in the South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences (XAMK) studying to become a **software developer**.

Programming has been my passion for a while now and I really like solving problems with code. I also enjoy building stuff and seeing my work/code come to life. I especially like the analytical and mathematical approach that coding brings to the table when faced with practical challenges.

At the moment I'm really into web and mobile development but I do like to dabble with Python and a little bit of data science too. Most of my coding is done using TypeScript/JavaScript and some Python (and of course the necessary HTML/CSS too).

* üíª I‚Äôm currently working on: Building my portfolio of different Web and mobile applications. Mostly using React, Next.js, Node.js, Express and SQL/NoSQL databases.
* üìñ I‚Äôm currently learning: More advanced web development stuff - Auth, Websockets, SSR/SSG in Next.js etc.
* üë®‚Äçüéì What I want to learn next: [tRPC](https://trpc.io), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) and so many other technologies that listing them all wouldn't make sense

## My projects:

- [**Citybike Tracking**](https://citybike-tracking.vercel.app) - App to track journeys and stations of Helsinki Citybikes
